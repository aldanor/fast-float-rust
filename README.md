This crate provides a super-fast decimal number parser from strings into floats.

```toml
[dependencies]
fast-float = "0.2"
```

There are no dependencies and the crate can be used in a no_std context by disabling the "std" feature.

*Compiler support: rustc 1.37+.*

## Usage

There's two top-level functions provided: 
[`parse()`](https://docs.rs/fast-float/latest/fast_float/fn.parse.html) and 
[`parse_partial()`](https://docs.rs/fast-float/latest/fast_float/fn.parse_partial.html), both taking
either a string or a bytes slice and parsing the input into either `f32` or `f64`: 

- `parse()` treats the whole string as a decimal number and returns an error if there are
  invalid characters or if the string is empty.
- `parse_partial()` tries to find the longest substring at the beginning of the given input
  string that can be parsed as a decimal number and, in the case of success, returns the parsed
  value along the number of characters processed; an error is returned if the string doesn't
  start with a decimal number or if it is empty. This function is most useful as a building
  block when constructing more complex parsers, or when parsing streams of data.

Example:

```rust
// Parse the entire string as a decimal number.
let s = "1.23e-02";
let x: f32 = fast_float::parse(s).unwrap();
assert_eq!(x, 0.0123);

// Parse as many characters as possible as a decimal number.
let s = "1.23e-02foo";
let (x, n) = fast_float::parse_partial::<f32, _>(s).unwrap();
assert_eq!(x, 0.0123);
assert_eq!(n, 8);
assert_eq!(&s[n..], "foo");
```

## Details

This crate is a direct port of Daniel Lemire's [`fast_float`](https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float)
C++ library (valuable discussions with Daniel while porting it helped shape the crate and get it to 
the performance level it's at now), with some Rust-specific tweaks. Please see the original
repository for many useful details regarding the algorithm and the implementation.

The parser is locale-independent. The resulting value is the closest floating-point values (using either 
`f32` or `f64`), using the "round to even" convention for values that would otherwise fall right in-between 
two values. That is, we provide exact parsing according to the IEEE standard. 

Infinity and NaN values can be parsed, along with scientific notation.

Both little-endian and big-endian platforms are equally supported, with extra optimizations enabled
on little-endian architectures.

## Testing

There are a few ways this crate is tested:

- A suite of explicit tests (taken from the original library) covering lots of edge cases.
- A file-based test suite (taken from the original library; credits to Nigel Tao), ~5M tests.
- All 4B float32 numbers are exhaustively roundtripped via ryu formatter.
- Roundtripping a large quantity of random float64 numbers via ryu formatter.
- Roundtripping float64 numbers and fuzzing random input strings via cargo-fuzz.
- All explicit test suites run on CI; roundtripping and fuzzing are run manually.

## Performance

The presented parser seems to beat all of the existing C/C++/Rust float parsers known to us at the
moment by a large margin, in all of the datasets we tested it on so far – see detailed benchmarks 
below (the only exception being the original fast_float C++ library, of course – performance of
which is within noise bounds of this crate). On modern machines like Apple M1, parsing throughput
can reach up to 1.5 GB/s.

In particular, it is faster than Rust standard library's `FromStr::from_str()` by a factor of 2-8x
(larger factor for longer float strings), and is typically 2-3x faster than the nearest competitors.

While various details regarding the algorithm can be found in the repository for the original
C++ library, here are few brief notes:

- The parser is specialized to work lightning-fast on inputs with at most 19 significant digits
  (which constitutes the so called "fast-path"). We believe that most real-life inputs should
  fall under this category, and we treat longer inputs as "degenerate" edge cases since it
  inevitable causes overflows and loss of precision.
- If the significand happens to be longer than 19 digits, the parser falls back to the "slow path",
  in which case its performance roughly matches that of the top Rust/C++ libraries (and still
  beats them most of the time, although not by a lot).
- On little-endian systems, there's additional optimizations for numbers with more than 8 digits
  after the decimal point.
